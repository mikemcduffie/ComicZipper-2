ComicZipper 2
=============
CREATE Comic Book Archives FAST and EASY with ComicZipper 2.

With a simple drag and drop, The ComicZipper 2 app lets you compress your folders, containing images, into zip archives (with the cbr-extension â€“ but in the future you'll be able to choose which format). 

Don't like to drag stuff? By simply selecting the folders the app will on launch automatically add the selection to the queue list.

ComicZipper also likes to clean up, so it even offers to delete the folders afterwards when the compression is done.

The compression is done via the Unix file packaging utility, zip.

## Usage
Tired of manually zipping and renaming your digital comic books after laboring for hours with (legally) scanning them? Well, no more. With **ComicZipper**, you can let the your computer do most of the work for you.

A simple drag and drop is all that is required to compress your folders – containing images – into zip archives for your comic book reading purposes.

**FEATURES**
* Drag and drop folders, either onto the app/dock icon or the application window, to add items to be compressed. You can also let the app automatically begin compression on drag and drop.
* ~~Exclude certain files or extensions from the resulting archive.~~ (Feature removed, but will be added soon again).
* **ComicZipper** also likes to clean up and offers to delete the original folders afterwards.
* And more.

### Compression
ComicZipper currently only supports zip-compression (.cbz files) and uses the framework [ZipUtilities](https://github.com/NSProgrammer/ZipUtilities). Support for rar-compression (.cbr files) will be added.

# ComicZipper 2
Create Comic Book Archives fast and easy with **ComicZipper 2**.

### Usage
With a simple drag and drop, **ComicZipper 2** lets you compress your folders, containing images, into zip archives for your comic book reading purposes.

~~But wait, there's more. Don't like to drag stuff? By simply selecting the folders you want to compress, **ComicZipper 2** will on launch automatically add the selected items to the queue list.~~

**ComicZipper 2** also likes to clean up, so it even offers to delete the folders afterwards when the compression is done.

### Compression
Currently the app only supports compression of folders to zip-files with the cbr-extension, which means that the images must be  neatly organized, with the correct numbering, in a folder. In the future, though, you should be able to create archives, organize the images and automagically set the filenames and order directly in **ComicZipper**.

The compression is done via the Unix file packaging tool, zip.

ComicZipper 2
=============
CREATE Comic Book Archives FAST and EASY with **ComicZipper 2**.

With a simple drag and drop, **ComicZipper 2** lets you compress your folders, containing images, into zip archives for your comic book reading purposes.

But wait, there's more. Don't like to drag stuff? By simply selecting the folders you want to compress, **ComicZipper 2** will on launch automatically add the selected items to the queue list.

**ComicZipper 2** also likes to clean up, so it even offers to delete the folders afterwards when the compression is done.

Currently the app only supports compression of folders to zip-files with the cbr-extension, which means that the images must be organized neatly organized, with the correct numbering, in a folder. In the future, though, you should be able to create archives, organize the images and automagically set the filenames and order directly in **ComicZipper**.

The compression is done via the Unix file packaging tool, zip.

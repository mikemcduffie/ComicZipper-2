ComicZipper checks items you drag & drop items to ensure they can be successfully converted to comic book archives. Non-folder items and folders without images, including empty folders, are rejected.

When you drag unallowed items onto the target window they will disappear from the dragged group and the group count badge will decrease accordingly. Only the allowed items (folders with images) will be added to the queue. 

If none of the dragged items are allowed, no items will be added and the dragged items and badge count will disappear completely when hovering over the target window.

If some of the dragged items are allowed, only those items will be added and the dragged items and badge count will adjust to the number of allowed items when hovering over the target window.

In droplet mode (when items are dragged to application icon), the application window will shake to indicate there was an issue with one or more items and only the allowed items (if any) will be added to the queue.

Again with some allowable items:

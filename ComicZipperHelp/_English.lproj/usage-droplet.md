You can use ComicZipper as a droplet app. 

Simply drag and drop folder(s) on the application icon. You can drap ComicZipper to the Dock and/or the Finder toolbar area as a convenient drag and drop target.

See the "Start processing items automatically" and "Quit after successful completion" options in ["Advanced Settings"](settings-advanced.html) to enable a seamless droplet experience.
